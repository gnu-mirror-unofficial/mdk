   Many people have further contributed to MDK by reporting problems,
suggesting various improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is a
list of these people. Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.

   * Richard Stallman (<rms@gnu.org>) suggested various improvements to
     the documentation and has always kept an eye on every MDK release.

   * Philip Ellis King (<pking@pdq.net>) provided MIXAL test programs
     pinpointing bugs in the first MDK release, and useful discussions
     as well. Philip has also contributed with the Emacs port of
     `mixvm' and influenced the `gmixvm' GUI design with insightful
     comments and prototypes.

   * Pieter E.J. Pareit (<pieter.pareit@skynet.be>) is the author of
     the Emacs MIXAL mode, and has also contributed many bug fixes.

   * Michael Scholz (<scholz-micha@gmx.de>) is the author of the
       German translation of MDK's user interface.

   * Sergey Poznyakoff(<gray@gnu.org>) provided patches to
     mixlib/mix_scanner.l improving MIXAL compliance.

   * Francesc Xavier Noria (<fxn@retemail.es>) kindly and thoroughly
     reviewed the MDK documentation, providing insightful advice.

   * Agustin Navarro (<anp@cantv.net>), Ying-Chieh Liao
     (<ijliao@csie.nctu.edu.tw>), Adrian Bunk (<bunk@fs.tum.de>),
     Baruch Even (<baruch@debian.org>) and Ronald Cole
     (<ronald@forte-intl.com>) created and/or maintain packages of MDK
     for different operating systems.

   * Jason Uhlenkott, Andrew Hood (<ajhood@fl.net.au>), Radu Butnaru
     (<rbb@email.ro>), Aleix Conchillo (<aleix@member.fsf.org>),
     Ruslan Batdalov (<linnando@tolkien.ru>), WeiZheng
     (<pro_zw@lol365.com>) and Sascha Wilde reported (sometimes with
     fixes) several bugs in MDK.

   * Nelson H. F. Beebe (<beebe@math.utah.edu>,
     http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe) has tested MDK in a lot of Unix
     platforms, suggesting portability enhancements to the source
     code.

   * Christoph von Nathusius (<nathusiu@gmx.net>), Stephen Ramsay
     (<sjr3a@virginia.edu>) and Johan Swanljung (<johanswa@yahoo.com>)
     tested MDK on different platforms.

   * Eli Bendersky (<spur4444@yahoo.com>), Milan Bella
     (<milanbella@hotmail.com>) and Jens Seidel reported several
     documentation bugs.

   * MDK was inspired by Darius Bacon's MIXAL program
     (http://www.accesscom.com/~darius/).
